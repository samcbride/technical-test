# Technical Test

I decided to write the technical test in React as I have recently been working with it through my bootcamp and thought it would lend well to this task.

I decided to structure this task in the following way:

- Main page (App.js)
  - Account number / submit button - this would ideally be statefull at some point, so different values could be put in and data returned based on those values
    - Eligible rewards (brought up when submit button clicked)
  - Channel List - this would contain props of all the listed channels

I found this to be quite a challenging assignment and certainly was lesson for figuring out props and state and how things are passed to each other in React.
